\section{Abstract}


The present paper describes a study that aims at assessment of driver behavior in response to new technology, particularly Adaptive Cruise Control Systems (ACCs), as a function of driving style. In this study possible benefits and drawbacks of Adaptive Cruise Control Systems (ACCs) were assessed by having participants drive in a simulator. The four groups of participants taking part differed on reported driving styles concerning Speed (driving fast) and Focus (the ability to ignore distractions), and drove in ways which were consistent with these opinions. The results show behavioral adaptation with an ACC in terms of higher speed, smaller minimum time headway and larger brake force. Driving style group made little difference to these behavioral adaptations. Most drivers evaluated the ACC system very positively, but the undesirable behavioral adaptations observed should encourage caution about the potential safety of such systems.
