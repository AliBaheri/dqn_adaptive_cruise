%\section{Acknowledgements}

It has been a long road to get to this point. Three years working through community college, another four for undergrad at VT, and another two for graduate school at VT. There are many people who have made a difference along the way, especially in this final stretch.

I want to thank my committee members, Dr. M. Cenk Cavusoglu and Dr. Gregory Lee for their guidance and being a part of my committee. I want to give an extra thank you to Dr. Cenk for your teaching in Algorithmic Robotics and Robotic Manipulaition which prepare me a software engineer in Robotics. The amount of knowledge in the DaVinci project is immense and never ceases to amaze me. You all have made work enjoyable and I hope those in the next workplace are just as fun.

I want to thank my Supervisor, Dr. Wyatt Newman. You were an excellent mentor and navigator when it came to discussing the possible solutions especially on new problems. Your passion for teaching, emphasis on education, and advice really influenced me continuing on to going deeper in robotics and AI.

Last, but certainly not least, thank you to my parents who are far away in China. I could not have had a better family to inspire, support, and encourage me through undergrad, graduate school, and life in general. It is through your love and support that I am who I am today.
